                <p>
                    Selling real estate for more than 16 years on the Lower North Shore has made me an expert when it comes to getting
                    record results in the area. I'm often described as being calm, courteous and professional, but what is really important
                    to me is getting the absolute best outcome for the sale of my client's property.
                    <br><br>
                    Being ranked in the top 1% of agents for a major real estate group year after year has come on the back of over 500
                    successful sales and a long list of record prices for my vendors. The results speak for themselves, but I'm more
                    interested in delivering exceptional customer service, great local knowledge and smart negotiation skills to get the top
                    price available in the marketplace at any given time.
                    <br><br>
                    As a Partner and Director of the company, I'm committed to the long-term success of the business while building enduring
                    client relationships that are based on mutual respect and trust. To do this, I make sure that every contact I have with
                    a new or existing vendor is an opportunity to raise the benchmark in quality of service, advice and results.

                    I love working with Shane and knowing that we provide our clients with exceptional personalised service, making every
                    transaction as straight forward as possible. As a true team, Shane is able to concentrate on the sales and negotiation
                    process, dealing directly with potential purchasers as he knows I will take care of all administration and
                    organisational tasks.
                    <br><br>
                    Our focus is on delivering exactly what we promise to, when we promise to and acting with integrity and care at all
                    times. Shane's wealth of experience selling real estate on the Lower North Shore combined with my communication degree
                    and background in corporate communications complement each other to provide outstanding results every time.
                    <br><br>
                    Working in a dynamic and progressive agency like Province is an absolute pleasure and ensures we can be industry leaders
                    in real estate marketing and service.
